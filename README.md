## About This Project

TechTrends is a mashup web app that reveals what‚Äôs trending in the tech world and where, based on real-time GitHub activity and Hacker News discussions. It helps tech enthusiasts discover interesting topics, emerging technologies, relevant news, and recently created code. By combining data from two major developer platforms, TechTrends aims to inspire exploration of what‚Äôs hot, where it‚Äôs happening, and why it matters.

This mashup uses the following APIs

- GitHub REST API
- Hacker News API
- MediaWiki Action API Wikipedia

GitHub is the world‚Äôs largest platform for developers to host, review, and collaborate on code. It provides access to millions of repositories and open source projects. Using the GitHub REST API, we can fetch real-time data such as trending repositories, author details, programming languages, and star counts.

Hacker News is a social news platform focused on technology, startups, and programming. It is run by Y Combinator and allows users to post, upvote, and comment on tech-related articles. With the Hacker News Firebase API, we can retrieve posts, comments, timestamps, and article metadata in real time.

Wikipedia is a free, collaborative online encyclopedia with content created and maintained by volunteers. It contains structured and unstructured information across nearly every topic. I used the MediaWiki Action API to query terms used in GitHub's repo data to get a new search result in a popup/modal (see the rainbow-colored language button in almost any GitHub repo card).
